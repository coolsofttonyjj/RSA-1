# RSA
RSA C++ implementation

Usage

The library includes function to encrypt, decrypt, key generation and Key struct, instruction in RSA_fun.h file

Size of block, precision of primality test and other parameters are settable in Define.h file

Random Number Generator

Random Number Generator included is only for testing, user can replace it with one of your own in Define.h file
(compatible with integer library)

AAA if it run slow

V.1.5 is set in 512 bit because the integer library is very slow, I replace it in the next version
