# RSA
RSA C++ implementation

Beta version

algorithm fully functional, but random number generator not sure and generate only 32 bit number (you can replace it in Define.h), key generation is not controlled with security parameters

Main file in for test

Usage

The library includes function to encrypt, decrypt and key generation, instruction in RSA_fun.h file
Size of block and precision of primality test are settable in Define.h file
